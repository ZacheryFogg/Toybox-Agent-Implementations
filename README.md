# Toybox-Agent-Implementations

Here are three Deep Reinforcement Learning agents implemented to train on the Toybox (https://github.com/ZacheryFogg/toybox-rs) MsPacman Atari environment. The three agents implemented are from StableBaselines3 (https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3): DQN - Q Learning, A2C - Actor Critic Method, PPO - Policy Optimization. Each agent was set to run on UVM's DeepGreen Cluster for 10 million timesteps.
